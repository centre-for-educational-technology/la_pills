  title: Feedback sessions @ Vihula Winter School
  date: 2017-01-13
  course:
  program: Ph.D. on Educational Sciences
  description:
    These parallel sessions are part of a winter school for PhD/Master
    students on Educational Sciences, at Estonian and Finnish universities. The basic
    idea of the sessions is for the students to present their PhD ideas to peers and
    supervisors, and get feedback on them, especially about certain open questions that
    the students may have (students were asked to explicitly refer to those in the presentations).
  technologies: # Those could use a list structure with short lines of text, current format is multiline without preserving the newlines (structure also allows to preserve the newlines if that would be needed)
    Powerpoint / Google presentations
goals:
  -
    title: Every student should have the chance to communicate what the current thesis ideas are
    short: &G1S Communicate
  -
    title: Every student should get input/feedback about the major open questions they have about their dissertation
    short: &G2S Feedback
