  description:
    This is a very simple kind of session, in which a person gathers longitudinal data daily for their own 
    self-experimentation and lifelong learning purposes.
  technologies: # Those could use a list structure with short lines of text, current format is multiline without preserving the newlines (structure also allows to preserve the newlines if that would be needed)
    Just this platform :)
