# External dashboard visualisation that replaces the default one
# Should be an object with three properties: url, width, height
# Only the url property is mandatory, others are optional
# Url could have a {{dataUrl}} replacement token that would be automatically
# replaced with the fully qualified URL that the data could be fetched from. The
# URL would be the same as one used by Download Answers functionality. Please
# note that URL will be URL encoded so that it could be safely used within the
# query string (though it could be a part of the URL itself if that is required:
# /endpoint/{{dataUrl}})
# Please note that optional parameters will get default values if not provided
# Example:
# dashboard:
#   url: https://some.domain?data-url={{dataUrl}}
#   width: 100%
#   height: 700px
