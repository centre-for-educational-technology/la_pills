  title: Interactive Feedback Session
  date: 2019-02-02
  course:
  program: Ph.D. on Digital Technologies
  description:
    These sessions are part of a winter school for PhD students. The basic
    idea of the sessions is for the students to present their PhD ideasYpapers to peers and
    supervisors, and get feedback on them, especially about certain open questions that
    the students may have (students were asked to explicitly refer to those in the presentations).
  technologies: # Those could use a list structure with short lines of text, current format is multiline without preserving the newlines (structure also allows to preserve the newlines if that would be needed)
    Powerpoint / Google presentations
goals:
  -
    title: Every student should have the chance to communicate about their current research ideas
    short: &G1S Communicate
  -
    title: Every student should get input/feedback about major open questions they have on their research
    short: &G2S Feedback

activities:
  -
    activity: Intro to the session goals and structure
    duration: 5 #minutes
    description: |- #preserves newlines
      Everybody should navigate to the session {{website}}, where these instructions can be seen. The session chair explains the dynamic of the session.
      Then, the following two activities are repeated as many times as needed until all students present and get feedback.
    resources:
  -
    activity: Student presentation block
    duration: 10-20 (each)
    description: |-
      Several students present in a row, with only minimal interruptions for clarifying questions (not actual discussions or longer points).
      1. Students present their ideas (in less than 10-20 minutes). Session chairs will ensure that the timing is respected (otherwise it will sustract from everyone's feedback time).
      2. After each individual presentation, while presenters switch computers, the audience provides basic feedback about the presentation in {{Q1}}
    resources:
  -
    activity: Breakout groups feedback block
    duration: 20
    description: |-
      Audience breaks out into as many small groups as presenters were in the previous block, and gather around each of the presenting students
      1. The small group appoints a note-taker (it can be the presenting student, or any other member of the breakout group), who will take note of the group responses/ideas/conclusions, and next actions in {{Q2}}
      2. The presenting student drives the breakout group to discuss the open questions noted in the presentation, or ask for feedback more generally. Once the time is over (as marked by the session chair), the note taker submits the form with the notes from the discussion, for the student's later reference.
      3. At any point, the members of a small group can decide to switch no another group, if they see that the discussion in the other groups interests them more.

    activity: Wrap-up
    duration:
    description: |-
      1. Prompted by the session chair, the breakout groups dissolve, and all come back to a whole-room configuration
      2. Each presenting student summarizes in 1 minute the single most interesting thing theyâ€™ve learned in the feedback and discussions.
